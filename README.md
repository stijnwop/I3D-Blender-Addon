As I am currently an university student, any amount will be greatly appreciated *(and will most likely be used for beer fueled coding binges, which translates into more features for the exporter)*

## Description

A project for updating the Giants Engine I3D exporter addon for blender 2.8

## Introduction

There is an existing exporter for blender supplied by Giants, but this isn't officially supported for newer blender versions and the code is outdated. The support from Giants themselves has also been lackluster and this project aims to supply a new addon with support and features driven by community feedback.


## Objectives

Current Priorities listed in order

1. Create a new addon, upholding standards put forth by both blender and python pep-8, that has a minimum of the same features as the currently available addon
2. Keep addon up to date with new version of Farming Simulator and Blender.
3. Add community requested features.


## Technologies
* Python 3.7
* PEP8-80 compliant (althought this may not always be possible
* Blender 2.82

## Status

* Working towards first feature-complete stable release

## Access

This has mostly been a solo project so far, but any help is appreciated.
In case of wanting to join, the following knowledge is required:
* Git version control
* Knowledge of Python 3
* Knowledge of Blender 2.8
